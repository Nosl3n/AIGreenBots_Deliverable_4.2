"""Drive the robot along a FIXED route of goals through the DSR graph, without the GUI — reproducible runs.

    python3 run_route.py                       # the default orchard route (all four corridors, serpentine)
    python3 run_route.py --route "1.25,-9.5 1.25,9 3.75,9" --tol 0.5 --timeout 90

Same mechanism as send_goal.py (a `goal` node of type `target` under the world frame, linked robot
-goto_action-> goal), but the goal MOVES to the next waypoint once the robot is within --tol of it, or once
--timeout seconds have passed for that waypoint (logged as a timeout, and the route goes on). Needs the
controller armed without a click: Controller.ArmOnStart = true (controller/etc/config_husky.toml).

The default route is for webots-agri/worlds/husky_field.wbt and husky_apple.wbt (rows at x = -5 ... 5, 2.5 m
apart, corridors at x = +-1.25, +-3.75), starting from the robot's spawn in the south headland; see DEFAULT_ROUTE
for why it is shaped around the workers. Run it a few seconds after cognitive.py, once the agents are Operating.

Agent id 98, like send_goal.py (CONCEPT_AGENT_RECIPE.md registry): run one of them at a time.
