// trunk_map.h — tree TRUNKS from two sensors: what the ZED calls "tree" low down, confirmed by the LiDAR.
//
// PURE Eigen (+ the header-only common/existence_belief): no DSR, no Qt, no Ice — unit-tested by self_test().
//
// ── WHY THE LOW BAND OF THE 'tree' MASK IS A TRUNK ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   ADE20K has no trunk class: its 'tree' is trunk and canopy together. But a tree's canopy starts above its
//   trunk, so the 'tree' pixels whose 3D point lies in a band just above the ground and below the first
//   branch are trunk (and its stake). MEASURED in husky_apple.wbt (2026-10-14, 2 min, 2.2 M vegetation points):
//   in z 0.30-0.55 m, 93.5% of 'tree' points lie within 0.12 m of a real trunk and 99.2% within 0.25 m, while
//   in 0.70-1.20 m only 32% do (that is canopy). 56 of the 60 trunks showed up there, ~17 frames each.
//
// ── TWO SENSORS, TWO ROLES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   * ZED (semantic): says WHAT — a trunk candidate is a compact cluster of band points on a ground grid.
//   * LiDAR (geometry): says THAT something solid is there, and WHERE to ~2 cm. A candidate is born as a trunk
//     only once the LiDAR returns band points on it (multimodal birth): a semantic mistake alone cannot
//     create an obstacle the robot will never be allowed to cross.
//
// ── A TRUNK IS PERMANENT UNTIL VERIFIED GONE (active inference) ─────────────────────────────────────────
//   * It MOVES: every observation (ZED band points, LiDAR band returns) pulls its estimate with a precision
//     weight; a small process noise lets a localisation correction carry it.
//   * It is REMOVED only through its existence belief, and absence is charged ONLY when the trunk should
//     have been seen: inside the camera's field of view and range, and with nothing in between — a foliage
//     disc of ANOTHER plant (vegetation_concept) or a person. An occluded trunk is not evidence of absence:
//     HOLD. Absence is the CAMERA's verdict only: the LiDAR places, confirms and moves trunks but never
//     removes one (carving a box per trunk on every sweep would cost more than this verdict is worth).
